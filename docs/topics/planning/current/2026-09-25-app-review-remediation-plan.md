# LeagueSphere App Review: Remediation Plan

**Date:** 2026-09-25
**Status:** Phases 1-3 done (2026-09-25). Phase 4-5 not started.
**Source:** Two independent code reviews of the whole app group (Django backend, five React apps, container and CI config), merged and re-prioritized. Findings come from reading code and running `black --check`; no tests were run and nothing was changed on the app itself.

## Progress

| Phase | Status | PR |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Settings and edge hardening | ✅ Done | merged directly to `master` (`e9aa7eda`) |
| 2 — Escaping, validation and access decisions | ✅ Done | [#1978](https://github.com/dachrisch/leaguesphere/pull/1978) |
| 3 — Shared cache and server-side result caching | ✅ Code done, **not deployed** | [#1979](https://github.com/dachrisch/leaguesphere/pull/1979) (suggestion PR) |
| 4 — Process, docs and repo hygiene | Not started | — |
| 5 — Frontend and backend code quality | Not started | — |

Notes on how execution diverged from the plan as written:

- All work was done from a sandboxed environment with no LXC/MariaDB test container and no access to stage/prod or the container repo's Ansible flow. Every fix was verified with `pytest` against `league_manager.settings.test_sqlite` instead of the real MySQL test DB, and nothing was verified with `curl`/click-through on stage as the "Verify" steps below call for — that step is still outstanding for every phase.
- **2.1** additionally fixed three related unescaped-output bugs found while adding test coverage on the same pages, beyond the five original `escape: False` sites: `EventsTableError`'s message (independent of the `to_html` escape flag), a JSON-LD `<script type="application/ld+json">` payload that could be broken out of with a team name containing `</script>`, and a stray `|safe` on `GameSetup.note` that had no markup to protect.
- **2.3** used the nginx `limit_req_zone` option, not `django-axes` — this fork has no Ansible/Redis access to satisfy axes' "needs a shared cache" prerequisite either, so the tradeoffs called out in the plan apply as written (doesn't cover `/api/accounts/auth/login/`; no automated regression test, since it's pure nginx config).
- **3.1**'s compose/settings/dependency changes are complete and locally verified (real Redis read/write, `docker-compose config` validation for all three files) but genuinely cannot be deployed from here — see PR #1979.
- **3.2** covers `LeagueTableAPIView.get()` and `GamedayViewSet.list()` only; the journey progress feed has no `etag_func` yet, so it needs one designed before this pattern applies there too.
- Discovered while adding 3.2's test coverage: under sqlite, `TestCase`'s savepoint rollback means rowids can be reused across tests, so two unrelated tests can compute the same ETag and one can serve the other's cached payload. Not a production risk (MySQL `AUTO_INCREMENT` never reuses pks), but real in this test suite — fixed by clearing the cache in the affected test base classes' `setUp()`.

Read this top to bottom. Phases are ordered by risk first, then effort. Each item says **what** is wrong, **where** it lives, **how** to fix it and **how to prove it**. Effort is S (under an hour), M (half a day), L (a day or more).

## Phase 1: Settings and edge hardening (one PR, no behaviour risk) — ✅ Done

Goal: close every High that is a config change. Target: a single PR touching `league_manager/settings/base.py`, `league_manager/settings/prod.py`, `league_manager/settings/stage.py` and the three nginx confs.

### 1.1 Fix `X_FRAME_OPTIONS` (item 1)
- **Where:** `league_manager/settings/base.py:230`, under `# ToDo deleteMe`.
- **Why:** `ALLOWALL` is not a valid value (only `DENY` and `SAMEORIGIN` are). Browsers drop the header, nginx adds nothing, so any site can iframe `/admin/`, the scorecard or passcheck and clickjack a logged-in staff user.
- **How:** Delete the line so Django's default `DENY` applies. If a view genuinely must be embedded, decorate that one view with `@xframe_options_exempt` or `@xframe_options_sameorigin`.
- **Verify:** `curl -I https://stage.leaguesphere.app/` shows `X-Frame-Options: DENY`. Add a test that requests `/` and asserts the header.

### 1.2 Secure cookies, HSTS and SSL redirect in prod and stage (item 2)
- **Where:** `prod.py` and `stage.py` set `SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER` but nothing else. Only `demo.py` sets the cookie flags.
- **How:** Add to both files:
  ```python
  SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True
  CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True
  SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True
  SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS = 60 * 60 * 24 * 30  # start at 30 days, raise to a year once stable
  SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS = True
  SECURE_REFERRER_POLICY = "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
  ```
  Exclude `/health/` from the SSL redirect with `SECURE_REDIRECT_EXEMPT = [r"^health/"]` if the container healthcheck hits it over plain HTTP.
- **Verify:** `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=league_manager.settings.prod python manage.py check --deploy` reports no cookie or HSTS warnings. Deploy to stage first and confirm login still works behind Traefik.

### 1.3 Security headers in nginx (item 3)
- **Where:** `container/nginx.conf:18-20`, `container/nginx.demo.conf:18-20`, `container/nginx.staging.conf:18-20`.
- **How:** Keep the coffee joke. Add in the same `location /` block:
  ```nginx
  add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
  add_header Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin" always;
  add_header Permissions-Policy "camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()" always;
  ```
  Leave `X-Frame-Options` and HSTS to Django (1.1, 1.2) so there is one owner per header. A Content-Security-Policy is a follow-up: 42 jsdelivr and 2 unpkg references plus 17 templates with inline scripts need SRI hashes or nonces first.
- **Verify:** `curl -I` on stage after deploy via `./container/deploy.sh stage`. Add `container/test-compose-network.sh` style check if practical.

### 1.4 Swap the middleware order (item 5)
- **Where:** `league_manager/settings/base.py:50-51`.
- **Why:** `MaintenanceModeMiddleware` calls `SiteConfiguration.objects.first()` on a cache miss with no try/except. With the DB down and a cold cache (every worker after a restart), it raises `OperationalError` and the user sees a 500. `DatabaseGuardMiddleware`, which exists precisely for that case, never runs.
- **How:** Put `DatabaseGuardMiddleware` above `MaintenanceModeMiddleware`. Also wrap the config lookup in the maintenance middleware in a `try/except OperationalError` that falls back to `scope: off`, so it is safe regardless of order.
- **Verify:** Test with a mocked `connection.cursor` raising `OperationalError`: request `/` and assert a redirect to `/database-error/`, not a 500.

### 1.5 Tighten CORS (item 8)
- **Where:** `base.py:13`, `CORS_ORIGIN_ALLOW_ALL = True`.
- **How:** Replace with `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [...]` listing the real front-end origins per environment (`prod.py`, `stage.py`, `demo.py`, `dev.py`). Credentials stay disabled.
- **Verify:** Preflight from an unlisted origin returns no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`.

### 1.6 Fail loudly on missing DB config (item 9)
- **Where:** `base.py`, `DATABASES` defaults to `user`/`user`@`127.0.0.1`.
- **How:** Keep the defaults for `dev.py` and `test_sqlite.py` only. In `base.py` read the env vars without defaults; in `prod.py` and `stage.py` assert they are set (or use `os.environ[...]` so a `KeyError` stops startup). Same for `SECRET_KEY`: prod should refuse to start without one.
- **Verify:** Starting prod settings without `MYSQL_HOST` raises at import time.

### 1.7 Small settings cleanups (part of item 19)
- Remove the duplicate `django.template.context_processors.request` (`base.py:81` and `:84`).
- Remove the unused `debug.log` file handler in `LOGGING` (`base.py:214`), or attach it to a logger on purpose.
- Delete the commented-out `DEBUG_DATE` and toolbar toggles in `dev.py`.

**Phase 1 done when:** `check --deploy` is clean for prod, stage shows the new headers, all existing tests pass, and the PR is under about 60 changed lines.

**Status:** Done, merged to `master` (`e9aa7eda`). `check --deploy` is clean and all existing tests pass; the "stage shows the new headers" verification is still outstanding (no stage access from this environment).

---

## Phase 2: Escaping, validation and access decisions — ✅ Done ([#1978](https://github.com/dachrisch/leaguesphere/pull/1978))

### 2.1 Stop rendering unescaped HTML from user-controlled names (item 4)
- **Where:** `gamedays/views.py:142`, `:228`, `:473`, `gamedays/service/tournament_service.py:114`, `matchreport/constants.py:30`, all `"escape": False` passed to pandas `to_html`, then `|safe` in `gamedays/templates/gamedays/statistics/league_statistics.html` and `matchreport/templates/matchreport/gameday_detail.html`.
- **Why:** Player and team names flow into those tables. A team manager (non-staff, via passcheck) can set a player name to `<img src=x onerror=...>` and it executes on the public league statistics page and in the staff match report.
- **How (TDD):**
  1. Write a test that creates a player named `<script>alert(1)</script>`, renders the statistics view and asserts the raw tag is **not** in the response body.
  2. Remove `"escape": False` everywhere. If some columns need markup (links, badges), build those cells with `django.utils.html.format_html` so only the markup is trusted and the data is escaped.
  3. Keep `|safe` only where the string is now guaranteed to come from `format_html`.
- **Verify:** The new tests pass; visually check the statistics and match report pages on stage.

### 2.2 Escape the officials import messages (item 7)
- **Where:** `officials/views.py:325`, `:390`, `:690` (`messages.success(..., mark_safe(created_entries))`, `mark_safe(f"{summary}<br>{detail}")`).
- **Why:** The strings contain official names from the DB and exception messages that echo CSV cell content (for example a `ValueError` from `int("<b>x</b>")`). Staff-only, so low reach, but it is a real stored/reflected XSS path.
- **How:** Build the message with `format_html_join("<br>", "{}", ((line,) for line in lines))` instead of string concatenation plus `mark_safe`.
- **Verify:** Test that an uploaded row containing `<b>` produces an escaped `&lt;b&gt;` in the message.

### 2.3 Rate-limit password logins (item 6)
- **Where:** `/login/` and `/admin/login/` are plain Django views (`league_manager/urls.py`); DRF's `AnonRateThrottle` covers only the API.
- **How:** Either add `django-axes` (`AXES_FAILURE_LIMIT = 5`, `AXES_COOLOFF_TIME = 1` hour, lock by username + IP) or add `limit_req_zone` in nginx for those two paths. Prefer `django-axes` because it also covers `/api/accounts/auth/login/` and logs attempts. Do this after Phase 3 if you pick axes, because it needs a shared cache to count across workers.
- **Verify:** Six wrong passwords in a row returns a lockout response; the test suite includes one such test.

### 2.4 Validate journey events (item 12)
- **Where:** `journey/views.py:19` (`JourneyEventViewSet.create` reads `request.data` directly).
- **How:** Run `self.get_serializer(data=request.data)` and `is_valid(raise_exception=True)` before creating. Add a `max_length` and an allow-list of `event_name` values, cap `metadata` size (for example 4 KB) in the serializer, and add a management command that deletes events older than 90 days.
- **Verify:** POST without `event_name` returns 400, not 500. Oversized metadata returns 400.

### 2.5 Decide on roster privacy (item 13)
- **Where:** `passcheck/templates/passcheck/roster_list.html:68-72`, `league_manager/sitemaps.py:155` (`PasscheckTeamSitemap`).
- **Why:** Anonymous visitors and search engines see first name, last name, pass number and join date of every player.
- **How:** This is a product decision, not a code bug. Options, cheapest first: (a) show the pass number column only when `is_user_or_staff`; (b) drop rosters from the sitemap and add `noindex`; (c) gate the whole roster behind login. Record the decision in `docs/topics/features/`.
- **Verify:** Anonymous GET of a roster page no longer contains pass numbers (if a or c).

**Phase 2 done when:** every `escape=False` and `mark_safe` call site has a test proving escaping, logins lock out, journey POSTs validate, and the roster decision is documented.

**Status:** Done, see [#1978](https://github.com/dachrisch/leaguesphere/pull/1978). Every item covered, including three bonus escaping fixes found on the way (see the Progress notes above). Login rate-limiting is nginx-based (verified locally against a stub backend), not django-axes — see 2.3 above.

---

## Phase 3: Shared cache and server-side result caching — ✅ Code done, not deployed ([#1979](https://github.com/dachrisch/leaguesphere/pull/1979))

### 3.1 Replace `LocMemCache` with Redis (item 10)
- **Where:** `base.py:62`; gunicorn runs `-w 6 --threads 2` in `deployed/docker-compose.yaml:42` and the demo and staging compose files.
- **Why:** Six workers means six private caches. Effects today: `AnonRateThrottle` "120/min" is really about 720/min; `/clear-cache/` clears one worker in six; maintenance mode can be on in one worker and off in another; the DB guard status is per worker; every cached value is rebuilt six times and lost on each deploy.
- **How:**
  1. Add a `redis` service to the three compose files (`deployed/docker-compose*.yaml`) with a named volume and a healthcheck, via the container repo's Ansible flow, never by hand on the server.
  2. Set `CACHES["default"]["BACKEND"] = "django.core.cache.backends.redis.RedisCache"` with `LOCATION` from `REDIS_URL`; keep `LocMemCache` in `dev.py` and `test_sqlite.py`.
  3. Add `REDIS_URL` to `.env_template` and `deployed/ls.env.staging.template`.
- **Verify:** On stage, toggle maintenance mode and confirm every request sees it immediately; hit `/clear-cache/` and confirm the ETag-based views recompute. Confirm throttle counts are shared by exceeding 120 anonymous requests per minute.

### 3.2 Cache computed standings and list payloads (item 11)
- **Where:** `league_table/api/views.py` (`LeagueTableAPIView.get` rebuilds a pandas DataFrame per request that lacks a matching ETag); the same pattern fits `GamedayViewSet.list` and the journey progress feed.
- **How:** The ETag function already knows when data changed. Use the ETag string as the cache key: on a miss, compute, `cache.set(etag, payload, 3600)`; on a hit, return the stored JSON. Wrap this in a small helper in `league_manager/utils/` so the three endpoints share it. Only meaningful once 3.1 is in, otherwise it is six caches again.
- **Verify:** Test with `assertNumQueries`: the second request with the same ETag runs only the ETag query. Run `k6 run load-test-k6.js` before and after and compare p95 in the Grafana k6 dashboard.

**Phase 3 done when:** Redis is deployed to stage and prod through Ansible, the throttle and maintenance behaviour are consistent across workers, and the k6 comparison is written to `docs/topics/` under reports.

**Status:** Code complete and locally verified (real Redis read/write through Django's cache API, `docker-compose config` validated for all three environments) in [#1979](https://github.com/dachrisch/leaguesphere/pull/1979) — but genuinely **not deployable from this fork**: no access to the container repo's Ansible flow. Treat #1979 as a suggestion PR; the Ansible rollout, stage/prod verification and k6 before/after comparison are all still outstanding and need someone with real infra access.

---

## Phase 4: Process, docs and repo hygiene

### 4.1 Make `black` real (item 14)
- **Where:** CLAUDE.md says "REQUIRED before pushing", `black --check .` fails on 136 files (34 gamedays, 20 `.claude`, 18 gameday_designer, 16 each in league_table, league_manager, journey), and neither `.circleci/continue.yml` nor the workflows run black.
- **How:** One formatting-only commit (`black .`), then add a `black --check .` step to the always-on CircleCI jobs next to `scope_coverage`, and add black to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. Add a `[tool.black]` section with an explicit `extend-exclude` for migrations if you want them left alone.
- **Verify:** CI fails on a deliberately unformatted file in a test PR.

### 4.2 Fix the documentation map (item 15)
- **Where:** `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md` link `docs/guides/contributor-guide.md`, `docs/guides/coding-standards.md`, `docs/guides/performance-guide.md`, `docs/guides/infrastructure-policy.md`, `docs/guides/infrastructure-performance-policy.md`, `docs/guides/setup-guide.md`, `docs/arch/architecture-overview.md` and `docs/testing/`. They live under `docs/topics/guides/`, `docs/topics/architecture/` and `docs/topics/testing/` since the May consolidation.
- **How:** Update the links. Delete `docs/AUDIT.md` and `docs/CONSOLIDATION_SUMMARY.md` (they describe a finished migration) or move them to `docs/topics/planning/history/`. Add a link checker (`lychee` or a 20-line Python script) to the always-on CI job so this cannot regress.
- **Verify:** Link checker passes.

### 4.3 Tidy the repo root (item 16)
- Move `CIRCLECI_IMPLEMENTATION.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md`, `RELEASE_FLOW_COMPARISON.md`, `RELEASE_PROCESS_ANALYSIS.md` into `docs/topics/planning/history/` or `docs/topics/deployment/`, as `docs/DOCUMENTATION.md` already requires.
- Move `e2e-game-test.js`, `find-game-id.js`, `step1-find-game.js`, `setup-gameday-for-today.js` and `capture_screenshot.sh` into `scripts/stage/` with a README, and remove the hard-coded username from `step1-find-game.js` (read it from an env var).
- Move `test_settings.py` to `league_manager/settings/test_e2e.py` and update `scorecard/tests/e2e/conftest.py` and `gameday_designer/tests/e2e/conftest.py`.
- Fold `GEMINI.md` and `QWEN.md` into `AGENTS.md` and make `CLAUDE.md` the Claude-specific delta only, so there is one source of truth. Decide whether the 35 module-level `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` pairs should also collapse to one file each.
- Delete `coverage-reports/` (only a README) and the `conductor/` tracks if they are no longer used.
- Update `.circleci/scope-mapping.txt` and `scope-exclude.txt` for every move and run `python3 scripts/check_scope_coverage.py`.

### 4.4 Config drift (item 17)
- `CLAUDE.md` says Django 5.2, `pyproject.toml` pins Django 6.0.8: fix the doc.
- `[tool.bumpversion] current_version = "4.26.4-rc.4"` is stale and release-please owns versioning: delete the bumpversion section and drop `bump2version` from test deps, or update it if it is still used for the `package.json` files.
- `[tool.setuptools.packages.find]` omits `gameday_designer`, `matchreport`, `journey`: add them.
- `.env.demo` uses `MYSQL_PASSWORD`/`MYSQL_DATABASE`, `base.py` reads `MYSQL_PWD`/`MYSQL_DB_NAME`: pick one naming and use it in `base.py`, `demo.py`, `.env_template` and the compose files.
- The 17 GitHub Actions workflows are marked deactivated in favour of CircleCI: delete them, or keep only `release-please*.yaml` if those still run.

**Phase 4 done when:** `black --check`, the link checker and `check_scope_coverage.py` all run in CI and pass, and the root holds only config files, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `LICENSE`, `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`.

---

## Phase 5: Frontend and backend code quality

### 5.1 One frontend toolchain (item 18)
- **Where:** five apps with five `package.json`, five ESLint, Vite and Vitest configs; exact pins in `gameday_designer` and `journey_dashboard`, carets elsewhere; `fe_template/` still carries `webpack.config.js` and a legacy `.eslintrc.json`.
- **How:** Introduce an npm workspace at the root (`package.json` `workspaces`), a shared `eslint.config.mjs` and `vite.shared.mts` that each app extends, and let Renovate group the shared deps. Delete `fe_template/` or rebuild it as the workspace template. Keep JS + Redux in liveticker and scorecard for now; converting them to TypeScript is a separate decision.
- **Verify:** `npm run eslint` and `npm run test:run` pass from the root for all apps; CircleCI node jobs still pass with the path scoping.

### 5.2 Remove lint suppressions (item 18)
- Nine `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` disables: `gameday_designer/src/components/ListDesignerApp.tsx:335,369,383`, `.../dashboard/GamedayDashboard.tsx:319`, `passcheck/src/components/GameOverview.tsx:32`, `PlayerModal.tsx:46`, `RosterOverview.tsx:60,74,91`. Each hides a possible stale closure. Fix by moving the effect body into `useCallback` with correct deps, or by using a ref for the value that must not retrigger.
- `passcheck/src/utils/api.ts:1` disables `no-explicit-any` for the whole file: type the API responses (the DRF serializers define the shape) and remove the directive.
- Two `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` disables in `GamedayMetadataAccordion.tsx:224` and `useFlowState.ts:142`: derive the value during render or use a reducer.

### 5.3 Split the giant files (item 18)
- `gameday_designer/src/hooks/useFlowValidation.ts` (1462 lines) into one module per validation rule with a small orchestrator.
- `gameday_designer/src/components/list/GameTable.tsx` (1005 lines) into row, header and editing components.
- Scorecard: replace the 16 hard-coded `/api/` string literals with one `api.js` client module.

### 5.4 Django nits (item 19)
- `league_manager/urls.py:154` and `:157` mount `journey.urls` twice; keep the API under `/api/journey/` and the HTML dashboard under `/journeys/` by splitting `journey/urls.py` into `api_urls.py` and `urls.py`.
- `ClearCacheView` mutates state on GET: make it POST with a CSRF-protected form or button.
- `RegisterAPI` inherits `IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly`, so only logged-in users can register: either set `AllowAny` on purpose or remove the endpoint.
- `Gameday.author` and the second FK at `gamedays/models.py:89` and `:292` use `on_delete=SET_DEFAULT, default=1`: switch to `SET_NULL` with `null=True`, or `PROTECT`.
- `league_manager/middleware/db_guard.py:54` bare `except:`: catch `NoReverseMatch`.
- Rename the "journey" concept or split the app: it is both user click tracking (`Journey`, `JourneyEvent`) and the game progress feed, and the module guide only describes the second.

### 5.5 Testing hygiene (item 20)
- `assertNumQueries` is used in 14 of 199 test files although CLAUDE.md calls it mandatory: add it to every API list and detail test, starting with `gamedays/tests/api/test_gameday_viewset.py`.
- Split `journey/tests.py` (795 lines) into a `journey/tests/` package by view.
- Remove `--capture=no` from `pytest.ini` addopts; use `-s` locally when needed.
- `scorecard/tests/e2e/` is empty but ignored in `pytest.ini`: delete the ignore or add the tests.

---

## Working agreements for every phase

- One PR per numbered item or per phase sub-section, never one PR per phase. Conventional commit prefixes (`fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`).
- TDD as in CLAUDE.md: write the failing test first for every code change in Phases 1 to 3.
- Before pushing: `black .`, `pytest`, `npm run eslint` and `npm run test:run` in each touched app, `python3 scripts/check_scope_coverage.py`.
- Every change is verified on stage (`./container/deploy.sh stage`) before merging to master; infra changes go through the container repo's Ansible, never by editing a server.

## Explicitly out of scope for now

- A full Content-Security-Policy (needs SRI or nonces for the 44 CDN references first; revisit after 5.1).
- Converting liveticker and scorecard from JavaScript + Redux to TypeScript.
- Replacing pandas in the standings and match report code paths.
